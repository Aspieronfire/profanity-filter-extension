# profanity-filter-extension

this is the begining of a profanity filter I am working on to allow parents control over the type of content their children are able to view on the internet. 

phase 1 of the filter is basic funtionality
i.e basic profanity filtering.

phase 2 is more advanced profanity filtering to handle odd spellings or leet speak spellings and spellings of that nature.

phase 3 will expand the extension to be configurable giving parents the ability to add words or remove words from filtering based on their preferences.

phase 4 with expand the extension to include the ability to restrict or block specific content on the internet like gambling sites or pornographic material in a basic manner.

phase 5 will expand the content blocking fucntionality to be more advanced and rely less on url based filtering and rely more on smart gathering of meta data about the site visited to enable dynamic blocking.
